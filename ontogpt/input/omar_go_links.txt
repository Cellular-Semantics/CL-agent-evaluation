The gene expression profile of astrocyte precursor cells in glioblastoma reveals involvement in several key biological processes. For each process, we identify additional genes required for functionality, noting cases where multiple genes can substitute.
Cilia-Mediated Signaling
This process involves Hedgehog pathway activation and environmental sensing via primary cilia. Beyond CFAP54, essential genes include:
IFT88 and IFT20: Required for intraflagellar transport and cilia assembly.
δ-tubulin and ε-tubulin: Form a complex necessary for centriole maintenance.
KIF3A: Kinesin motor protein for anterograde ciliary transport.
Substitutes: Multiple tubulin isoforms (e.g., β-tubulin) can compensate for structural roles.
Metabolic Reprogramming (Glycolysis)
Characterized by Warburg effect and hypoxia adaptation. Beyond IGFBP7, critical genes are:
HIF-1α: Master regulator of hypoxia response.
PFK-1 and LDH-A: Key glycolytic enzymes.
PKM2: Pyruvate kinase isoform regulating glycolytic flux.
Substitutes: GLUT1/GLUT3 transporters interchangeably facilitate glucose uptake.
Pro-Survival Mechanisms
Focused on apoptosis resistance. Beyond VOPP1, required genes include:
BCL2 and BCL-XL: Anti-apoptotic proteins inhibiting mitochondrial permeabilization.
WWOX: Tumor suppressor targeted by VOPP1.
Substitutes: Multiple BCL2 family members (e.g., MCL1) provide functional redundancy.
Astrocyte Function (Glymphatic System)
Involves water homeostasis and waste clearance. Beyond AQP4, essential genes are:
TRPV4: Ion channel coordinating with AQP4 in volume regulation.
KCC1 and ClC2: Ion transporters maintaining osmotic balance.
Dystroglycan complex: Anchors AQP4 to astrocyte endfeet.
Hypoxia Response and Mitochondrial Biogenesis
Centers on oxygen sensing and energy adaptation. Beyond LANCL2, key genes include:
AMPK and PGC-1α: Regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis.
HIF-1α: Activates hypoxia-response genes.
Substitutes: HIF-2α can partially compensate for HIF-1α functions.
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response
Manages protein folding and lipid metabolism. Beyond RTN1, required genes are:
IRE1α: UPR sensor activating XBP1 splicing.
MANF: ER-resident chaperone interacting with RTN1.
Substitutes: PERK and ATF6 UPR branches provide parallel stress responses.
Neurodegenerative Processes
Links to senescence and neuronal dysfunction. Beyond MTRNR2L12, critical genes include:
p16 and p21: Senescence effectors inducing cell-cycle arrest.
TDP-43: RNA-binding protein regulating cryptic exon splicing.
Substitutes: p15 and p27 can partially replace p16/p21 in cell-cycle control.
