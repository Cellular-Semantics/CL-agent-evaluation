A type of glial cell primarily found in the mammalian central nervous system, distinguished by star-shaped morphology and capacity for calcium signaling (1,2). In humans, astrocytes facilitate various functions such as modulation of synaptic transmission, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and regulation of brain metabolism (3,4). These cells also play essential roles in neurogenesis and neuronal survival in response to injuries. Molecular markers including GFAP, a filament protein specific to mature astrocytes, as well as S100B, a protein found predominantly in astrocytes within the brain, are crucial for their identification in various species (5,6). The development and diversification of astrocytes are largely influenced by transcription factors like NFIA and STAT3 (7,8).
