  assertion1: Astrocytes are found primarily in the mammalian central nervous system.
  assertion2: Astrocytes are distinguished by a star-shaped morphology.
  assertion3: Astrocytes have molecular markers including GFAP, a filament protein
    specific to mature astrocytes, and S100B, a protein found predominantly in astrocytes
    within the brain.
  assertion4: The capacity for calcium signaling is a key component of astrocytes.
  assertion5: Astrocytes facilitate various functions such as modulation of synaptic
    transmission, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and regulation of brain metabolism.
  assertion6: Astrocytes play essential roles in neurogenesis and neuronal survival
    in response to injuries.
  assertion7: The development and diversification of astrocytes are largely influenced
    by transcription factors like NFIA and STAT3.
