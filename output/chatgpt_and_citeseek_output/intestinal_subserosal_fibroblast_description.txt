A type of fibroblast resident in the subserosal layer of the intestine, characterized by its essential role in maintaining intestinal structural integrity and potential involvement in pathological conditions such as fibrosis and inflammation (1). Distinctive features include a spindle-shaped appearance and high production of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen type I and fibronectin (2,3). In mice, this cell type displays a unique molecular profile with the expression of markers such as PDGFRÎ± and CD90.2 (3,4). It also contributes to the host's immune response through its capacity to produce cytokines and chemokines (5). The development of these cells is regulated by mechanisms involving key transcription factors, including ACTA2 and MYH11 (6,7).
