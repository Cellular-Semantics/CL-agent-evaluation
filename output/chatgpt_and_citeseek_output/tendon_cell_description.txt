A cell found within the fibrous connective tissue that connects muscle to bone, distinguished by an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology, and the production of collagen type I (1,2) in species such as humans and mice. This cell, also known as a tenocyte, plays a critical role in tendon formation, repair, and maintaining tendon homeostasis. It is responsible for biosynthesizing tendinous extracellular matrix, which mainly comprises collagen fibers and proteoglycans, important for the mechanical strength and flexibility of tendons. Its development and function are heavily linked to the transcription factor Scx (Scleraxis), a crucial marker for tendon progenitor cells and mature tenocytes (3,4).
