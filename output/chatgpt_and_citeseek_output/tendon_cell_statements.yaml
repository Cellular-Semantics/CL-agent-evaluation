  assertion1: Tendon cell is found within the fibrous connective tissue that connects
    muscle to bone.
  assertion2: Tendon cell has an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology.
  assertion3: Tendon cell is responsible for biosynthesizing tendinous extracellular
    matrix, which mainly comprises collagen fibers and proteoglycans.
  assertion4: Tendon cell produces collagen type I in species such as humans and mice.
  assertion5: Tendon cell is also known as a tenocyte.
  assertion6: Tendon cell plays a critical role in tendon formation and repair.
  assertion7: Tendon cell is involved in maintaining tendon homeostasis.
  assertion8: Tendon cell's development and function are heavily linked to the transcription
    factor Scx (Scleraxis), a crucial marker for tendon progenitor cells and mature
    tenocytes.
