A specialized form of epithelial cell indigenous to the thymus, discernible from other cell types within this general class by its distinctive features: elongated microvilli and immunological functions rooted in its tight junctions and ion channels. Significant markers such as DCLK1, as observed in mice and humans, along with other specific transcription factors like POU2F3 and Gfi1b (1,2), play an indispensable role in identifying the cell type and guiding its development. This cell is central to promoting type 2 immunity and other immune responses, even demonstrating a capacity for the self-renewal of the thymic epithelium (3,4). Although not found in all species, its presence has indeed been confirmed in mammals like mice and humans.
