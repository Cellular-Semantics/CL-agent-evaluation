Unlike resident KCs, which originate from yolk-sac progenitors and self-renew under homeostasis, monocyte-derived KCs emerge during liver injury, inflammation, or KC depletion to replenish the macrophage pool[1][3][6][14]. These cells exhibit partial transcriptional overlap with resident KCs but retain unique features tied to their hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin[13][19]. They contribute critically to liver inflammation, fibrosis resolution, and tissue repair but also drive pathology in metabolic, infectious, and toxic liver diseases[3][5][7][9][18].  \n\n### Ontogeny and Developmental Plasticity  \nMonocyte-derived Kupffer cells arise when circulating CCR2\u207aLy6C\u02b0\u2071 monocytes extravasate into the liver sinusoids in response to injury signals (e.g., CCL2, M-CSF)[4][19]. Following niche engraftment, they undergo transcriptional reprogramming, downregulating monocyte markers (CCR2, Ly6C) while acquiring KC-associated genes (CLEC4F, TIM4, ID3, SPIC)[2][5][14][17]. This differentiation is regulated by:  \n- **Notch-RBPJ signaling**: Drives monocyte-to-KC transition by suppressing inflammatory pathways and promoting lipid metabolism genes (CD36)[9].  \n- **Stromal cues**: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocyte-derived factors (HGF) provide niche signals for KC-like maturation[2][16].  \n- **Epigenetic remodeling**: Post-infection, monocyte-derived KCs retain altered chromatin accessibility, enabling \"trained immunity\" that modulates future responses[11].  \n\nCrucially, monocyte-derived KCs achieve self-renewal capacity, persisting for months as functional tissue-resident macrophages[14]. In clodronate-induced KC depletion models, bone marrow-derived monocytes repopulate >80% of the KC compartment within 14 days, expressing Clec4f and performing phagocytosis[14][15]. However, they exhibit reduced proliferative activity compared to embryonic KCs and distinct spatial localization in injury zones[5][17].  \n\n### Phenotypic and Functional Heterogeneity  \nMonocyte-derived KCs display context-dependent phenotypes beyond the M1/M2 dichotomy:  \n- **Homeostatic functions**: They contribute to pathogen clearance, efferocytosis, and antigen presentation but exhibit reduced immunosuppressive capacity compared to embryonic KCs[6][17].  \n- **Injury responses**:  \n  - In **acute liver injury** (e.g., acetaminophen), monocyte-derived KCs phagocytose necrotic debris and produce MMP12/13 to remodel extracellular matrix, facilitating repair[5][18].  \n  - In **metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)**, they adopt a pro-inflammatory state (TNF-\u03b1\u207a, IL-1\u03b2\u207a) that drives insulin resistance and fibrosis, whereas embryonic KCs exhibit restorative signatures[9][19].  \n  - During **liver regeneration**, they interact with hepatic stellate cells to modulate fibrogenesis and secrete pro-angiogenic factors (VEGFA)[5][7].  \n\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing reveals subsets expressing fibrosis-associated genes (e.g., *Fmnl1*, *Myh9* in NASH), which correlate with collagen deposition[10]. Spatial analyses in carbon tetrachloride-induced injury show monocyte-derived KCs cluster around central veins, interacting with neutrophils and endothelial cells to orchestrate inflammation resolution[5][18].  \n\n### Role in Liver Pathophysiology  \n#### Disease Pathogenesis  \n- **Fibrosis progression**: Monocyte-derived KCs produce TGF-\u03b2\u2081, PDGF, and galectin-3, activating hepatic stellate cells and promoting collagen deposition[7][19]. CCR2 inhibition reduces their recruitment, improving fibrosis in NASH models[19].  \n- **Viral hepatitis**: They present antigens to CD8\u207a T-cells and secrete CXCL10 to recruit lymphocytes, exacerbating immunopathology[3][4].  \n- **Tumor microenvironment**: In hepatocellular carcinoma, they express PD-L1 and IL-10, fostering immunosuppression and tumor growth[3][7].  \n\n#### Resolution Mechanisms  \n- **Inflammation control**: Late-stage monocyte-derived KCs upregulate IL-10 and arginase-1, dampening neutrophil activity and promoting T-reg recruitment[18].  \n- **Fibrosis regression**: During recovery, they shift to a restorative phenotype (CD206\u207a, RELM\u03b1\u207a) that degrades matrix via MMP9 and enhances hepatocyte proliferation[7][17].  \n\n### Therapeutic Targeting Strategies  \nApproaches to modulate monocyte-derived KC function include:  \n- **CCR2/CCR5 inhibition**: Cenicriviroc blocks monocyte recruitment, reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in NASH[19].  \n- **Notch-RBPJ modulation**: Silencing RBPJ in monocytes enhances protective Ly6C\u02e1\u1d52 subsets that improve endothelial function in MASH[9].  \n- **Macrophage subset reprogramming**: Engineered nanoparticles deliver IL-4 or PPAR\u03b4 agonists to promote pro-resolving KC phenotypes[1][7].  \n\n### Conclusion and Future Perspectives  \nMonocyte-derived Kupffer cells are essential players in liver homeostasis and disease, exhibiting plasticity that allows dual roles in pathology and repair. Their ontogeny, spatial distribution, and functional divergence from embryonic KCs highlight their therapeutic relevance. Future research should focus on:  \n1. **Single-cell epigenomics** to map differentiation trajectories in human liver diseases.  \n2. **Niche engineering** using human pluripotent stem cell-derived LSECs to generate functional human KCs for disease modeling[16].  \n3. **Temporal targeting** strategies that selectively inhibit pathogenic subsets while preserving restorative functions.  \n\n---  \n\n### References  \n1. van der Heide et al.
