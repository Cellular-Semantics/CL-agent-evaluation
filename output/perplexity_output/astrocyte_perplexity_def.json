                "content": "A glial cell subtype within the central nervous system, distinguished by a star-shaped morphology with numerous processes that contact both neurons and capillaries, and exhibiting regional heterogeneity such as fibrous forms in white matter and protoplasmic forms in gray matter[1][3]. These cells regulate synaptic transmission by uptaking neurotransmitters like glutamate and GABA, maintain extracellular ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis, support the blood\u2013brain barrier, and participate in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis[2][5]. They are present in both vertebrates and invertebrates, with key identification in mammals often relying on expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)[1][5]. Their proliferative capacity persists postnatally, and they respond to injury by dividing and occupying spaces left by damaged neurons[3][5]."
