                "content": "A fibroblast-like connective tissue cell found predominantly within the dense, collagen-rich matrix of tendons, distinguished by an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology and extensive cytoplasmic processes that interconnect via gap junctions[3][4][5]. This cell type is responsible for the synthesis, maintenance, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, particularly type I collagen, conferring tendons their tensile strength and viscoelastic properties[3][4]. Located between collagen fibers in the endotenon and epitenon, these cells adapt to mechanical loading and are arranged in longitudinal rows aligned with the tendon\u2019s axis[3][4]. In vertebrates, they constitute the majority of tendon-resident cells, with their development and identity marked by expression of the transcription factor scleraxis in species such as mice[4]."
