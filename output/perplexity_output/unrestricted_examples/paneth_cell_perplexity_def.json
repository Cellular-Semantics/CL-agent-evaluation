                "content": "**Paneth cells** are highly specialized secretory epithelial cells found at the base of the **crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn** in the small intestine, positioned adjacent to **intestinal stem cells**[2][5]. Their primary role is to maintain intestinal health by supporting host defense and modulating the gut environment[2][3][5].\n\n**Key features and functions:**\n\n- **Antimicrobial Defense:**  \n  Paneth cells secrete a range of **antimicrobial peptides and proteins**, most notably **\u03b1-defensins (cryptdins)**, **lysozyme**, and **phospholipase A2**[3]. These molecules disrupt bacterial membranes and play a crucial role in protecting the gut from pathogenic microbes while maintaining the balance of the normal microbiota[1][3].\n  \n- **Support of Stem Cells:**  \n  By residing next to intestinal stem cells in the crypts, Paneth cells provide **niche signals** that are essential for the maintenance, protection, and proper functioning of these stem cells, thus supporting **epithelial renewal and repair**[1][2][3].\n\n- **Immune Modulation:**  \n  Paneth cells act as a **physical and immune barrier**, sensing bacteria through **toll-like receptors (TLRs)**, especially TLR9, and secreting antimicrobials in response to bacterial products or during inflammation[1]. This contributes to the regulation of immune responses and homeostasis in the gut.\n\n- **Response to Injury:**  \n  Beyond their secretory function, Paneth cells can sometimes switch to a stem cell-like, proliferative phenotype to assist in **epithelial repair** following injury[3].\n\n**Clinical significance:**\n\n- Disorders of Paneth cell function or loss of these cells have been linked to diseases such as **Crohn\u2019s disease** and **necrotizing enterocolitis**, highlighting their essential role in gut health and disease pathogenesis[2][5].\n\nIn summary, **Paneth cells** are critical for **intestinal immunity**, the **maintenance of the stem cell niche**, and the overall **homeostasis** of the intestinal epithelium[2][3][5]."
