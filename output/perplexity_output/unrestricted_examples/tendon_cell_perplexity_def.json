                "content": "**Tendon cells** are specialized cells found within tendons, which are dense connective tissue structures that transmit the force generated by muscle contraction to bones[5][3]. The main types of tendon cells are **tenoblasts** and **tenocytes**[1][5][3].\n\n- **Tenoblasts** are immature tendon cells. They are generally round to spindle-shaped, highly proliferative, and primarily responsible for **synthesizing collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix** during tendon growth and repair[1][5]. As tenoblasts mature, they transform into tenocytes.\n- **Tenocytes** are the **mature, spindle-shaped tendon cells**. They make up the majority of cellular content in tendons (about 90-95% of tendon cells)[1][5]. Tenocytes are elongated, lie in rows between collagen fibers, and maintain the **extracellular matrix**, particularly by regulating the turnover of collagen and other matrix molecules in response to mechanical load[1][5]. They are also involved in cell-to-cell communication via gap junctions, which utilize connexin proteins (notably connexin 43, 26, and 32) to coordinate metabolic and regenerative activities within the tendon[1].\n\nIn addition to tenoblasts and tenocytes, tendons contain smaller populations of other cell types such as **chondrocytes, synovial cells, and vascular cells**[1].\n\nA more recently identified tendon cell population is **tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs)**. These exhibit a tendon-like phenotype and are being studied for their role in tendon repair and regeneration due to their stem cell properties[2].\n\nIn summary:\n- **Tenoblasts:** Immature, highly proliferative, collagen-producing cells.\n- **Tenocytes:** Mature, elongated cells responsible for matrix maintenance and adaptation to stress.\n- **Tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs):** Stem cell-like cells with regenerative potential[2].\n\nThe composition and organization of tendon cells within the collagen-rich matrix give tendons their unique strength and ability to adapt to mechanical forces[3][5]."
